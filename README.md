# EmptyMvc

The point of EmptyMVC is simple... I don't like the new way of creating MVC5 applications in Visual Studio, so I created a blank project to use as a starting point.

Hope this helps someone else out along the way, too!

Attribute routing is configured, too :)

Just download, run the renamer to rename all the files to your new project name, open the solution, and get started!
