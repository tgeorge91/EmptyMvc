# EmptyMVC

EmptyMVC is just a starter template that I like to use when creating new web applications. It's minimal but contains most functionality that I use in a normal project.

It has the following installed as well:

* Newtonsoft Json.NET
* MVC / Razor
* Web API 2.2
* Default Home page configured
* Attribute Routing configured

Just download, run the renamer to rename all the files to your new project name, open the solution, and get started!

I just hope this helps someone else out along the way, too, because it certainly makes my life easier!
